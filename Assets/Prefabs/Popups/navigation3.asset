  title: Navigation, Part 3
  mainText: When on longer journeys, the <b>golden fish</b> won't always be around.
    This is when <b>Landmarks</b> become essential for navigating! The golden fish
    tend to flock around Landmarks; <b>approach one and they will point you to the
    next step on your journey</b>. They won't stay with you forever though, so keep
    an eye on your Compass, and keep your heading true.
