    text: "One of the Deep\u2019s scriptures tells that a race of creature bred by
      Sul; <b>great leviathans</b> who swam through the world above water; fell to
      the seas when the Deep wrapped the world in its waves. @In the world above,
      these leviathans had been charged with carrying the damned souls of the dead
      to their eternal torment. @However, with their demise, the Deep created <b>a
      portal to hell within the skull of the largest leviathan</b>, and it is this
      portal which draws the damned souls towards it so they can finally receive punishment
      for their sins and wicked ways."

      souls will be sucked from their bodies and they will be damned for eternity,
      regardless of how righteous a life they have led.
