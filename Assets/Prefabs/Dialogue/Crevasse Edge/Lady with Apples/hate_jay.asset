  previewText: "Player: [Eavesdrop]\n\nKat Smith: Hey, you\u2019re the lady we saw
    at <b>Crevasse Edge</b> earlier... you really hate Jay, don\u2019t you?\nMe: He
    has no business parading around the abyss talking about helping people after what
    he did.\nKat Smith: Hey, you\u2019re being really unfair! Jay\u2019s one of the
    best people I\u2019ve ever sailed with! @ He joined the Captain to get to the
    Endless Corridor so he could help everyone, and he\u2019s always beating himself
    up over what happened to the Morgensonne people! \nMe: Why should I believe you?\nKat
    Smith: Why would you believe what the Spirios hate machine is spewing? @Like,
    we got kicked out of the competition they were running, so we\u2019re not going
    back to their city any time soon. @So why would they tell everyone Jay\u2019s
    been helping the Spirios side unless it\u2019s to isolate him from everyone else?\nMe:
    I can\u2019t say I thought about that...\nKat Smith: Exactly! So really, you should
    be hating Spirios for turning on you during an alliance instead of hating on Jay!\nMe:
    You have... given me a lot to think about. @My name is <b>Victoria Morgensonne</b>.
    I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll see you again."
