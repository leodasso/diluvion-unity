      hear some outlandish tales from our trading vessels about your Tear and how
      she sails these waters without a crew. All false, I can tell you that.

      away from me. @I want her back. @You may have seen the Naglfar already, as she's
      so large she becomes part of the scenery. @Disable her so my ships can move
      in to capture the vessel, and you will have your flower. Now leave. I grow bored
      of you.
