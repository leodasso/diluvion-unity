    the fleet-eater. @The city. @Sized. @Submarine.\nJay Treadwasser: Kat may be an
    idiot, but she\u2019s on to something. @We don\u2019t need to battle the Naglfar;
    we just have to dock to its underbelly, sneak into the reactor, and take what
    we need. A bit of helming finesse will go a long way."
