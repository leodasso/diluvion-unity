    Player: Why do you hold a race to the Endless Corridor every year?


    Me: House Spirios is committed to funding and supporting projects that will advance
    not only our household, but also mankind''s knowledge. @It is believed that the
    Endless Corridor is in fact a library where all of the pre-fall knowledge was
    left for safekeeping. @If we can access this, then at the very least, we will
    be able to raise ourselves above our current living conditions.'
