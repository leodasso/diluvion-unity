    We did. She\u2019s gone back to the Sunken Coast.\nMe: That\u2019s something,
    at least.@ You see the damage to her hull? She got that trying to protect us.
    @Had a clear run back out the way she came, but still responded to the distress
    call we sent out.\nJay Treadwasser: What exactly is going on out there?\nMe: Those
    monsters are swarming anything man-made that goes anywhere near \u2018em.@ The
    treasure is a lie, the houses are probably just using us against the other. @I
