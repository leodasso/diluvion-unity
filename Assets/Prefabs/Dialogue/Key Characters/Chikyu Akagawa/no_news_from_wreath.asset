    Me: I have still heard no news from Scott Wreath. From what I''ve gathered, some
    of the patrons in the Parting of Ways had been feeding him tales of a ghost ship
    that was destroyed by the Spirios navy. @Apparently it was seen entering the sewers
    below the city so I''d assume that''s where he went.'
