    Player: Salvage? What for?


    Me: Did you already forget why we''re down here, captain? @ We need to find salvage
    so the <b>Engineer''s Guild</b> can upgrade our sub! @ The best way to find it
    is with sonar.

    Gregory Hudson: Yea...@ I can detect salvage using sonar. I can''t be too sure
    what something is until I have a good read on it, but for objects that I''m sure
    of, I''ll put their name up for you.'
