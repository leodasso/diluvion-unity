    to Victoria...\nJay Treadwasser: Who?\nMe: The lady who yelled at you in the marketplace?
    @Apparently she knows you pretty well?\nAlison Hosstrevar: She called herself
    Victoria? You seriously didn\u2019t think who that might be?\nMe: ...What?\nJay
    Treadwasser: What are you getting at?\nAlison Hosstrevar: You have got to be the
    densest people in the Ocean. @ First, we're attacked by a ship that was <i>supposedly</i>
    destroyed in some old battle, which only starts attacking bounty hunters who work
    for House Spirios.  @Oh, and this ship <i>just happens</i> to have been piloted
    by someone who has a reason to hate the former Admiral of the Morgensonne Navy.
    @On top of that, someone with the feminised name of this Captain, who lashed out
    when you suddenly shows up? @Helloooo?\nJay Treadwasser: We don't know how long
    Victoria's been down in the Abyss. @You have no proof that she was even in the
    Sunken Coast at the same time we were...\nMe: Hey, now I remember. @Victoria was
    the one asking questions about Jay back in Birchton! @...@Oh..."
