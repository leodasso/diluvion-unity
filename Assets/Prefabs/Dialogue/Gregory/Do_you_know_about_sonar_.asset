    can't hear very far. That's where the <b>sonar ping</b> comes in; send out a ping
    and it will <b>greatly increase my hearing range</b>. The more you charge a ping,
    the more I'll be able to hear. @For contacts I have a better read on, I can even
    put up a <b>targeting lead</b> for you, if they're in range of the guns."
