    Player: Tell me a bit about torpedoes.


    Me: Well, uh, as long as you have a target on sonar, I can lock on to it. Torpedoes
    can be charged up, which will increase their damage, but a charged torpedo is
    less stable. @ I like to call it <i>gambling a torpedo</i>, because you can get
    a really critical hit on an enemy this way, but it''s risky.'
