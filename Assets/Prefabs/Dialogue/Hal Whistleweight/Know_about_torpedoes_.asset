    Player: How do I use torpedoes?


    Me: Listen up mate. A torpedo can <i>only</i> launch if it has a target. And you
    can <i>only</i> target something if the sonar is tracking it.@ Got it? No sonar,
    no torpedoes. @<b>Move the reticule over a target</b>, and once you see a target
    lock, fire away. @Torpedoes home in on the target, but they ain''t perfect. <b>The
    more crew in this station, the less likely the torpedo is to fail</b>.'
