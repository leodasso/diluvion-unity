  doom: The surrounding structure has taken all the abuse it can. It buckles under
    the pressure with an ear piercing groan; your party barely escapes to the safety
    of your ship.
  mildWarning: Much of the support structure is bent or broken. "This isn't looking
    too good...," [rand] says nervously.
  extremeWarning: '"Captain, get us the hell out of here!" Yells [rand] over the radio.'
